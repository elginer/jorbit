JOrbit is a clone of a game called Orbit which we had in primary school.  It was available for Acorns or BBC computers, or some such!

JOrbit is my clone, written in javascript, with raphael and jQuery.

Orbit was originally for two players, or you could play against an AI.  However, you could play against yourself, which is the only option available here.

Instructions:

Attempt to hit the target
Move the mouse to aim
Press the left mouse button to charge
Watch the force meter!
Let go to fire
If you get an impossible level just refresh
